# Migrating from previous versions to <unreleased>
The `SDKSynchronizer` no longer uses `NotificationCenter` to send notifications.
Notifications are replaced with `Combine` publishers.

`stateStream` publisher replaces notifications related to `SyncStatus` changes.
These notifications are replaced by `stateStream`:
- .synchronizerStarted
- .synchronizerProgressUpdated
- .synchronizerStatusWillUpdate
- .synchronizerSynced
- .synchronizerStopped
- .synchronizerDisconnected
- .synchronizerSyncing
- .synchronizerEnhancing
- .synchronizerFetching
- .synchronizerFailed

`eventStream` publisher replaces notifications related to transactions and other stuff.
These notifications are replaced by `eventStream`:
- .synchronizerMinedTransaction
- .synchronizerFoundTransactions
- .synchronizerStoredUTXOs
- .synchronizerConnectionStateChanged

`latestState` is also new property that can be used to get the latest SDK state in a synchronous way.
`SDKSynchronizer.status` is no longer public. To get `SyncStatus` either subscribe to `stateStream` 
or use `latestState`. 

# Migrating from previous versions to 0.18.x
Compact block cache no longer uses a sqlite database. The existing database
should be deleted. `Initializer` now takes an `fsBlockDbRootURL` which is a 
URL pointing to a RW directory in the filesystem that will be used to store
the cached blocks and the companion database managed internally by the SDK.

`Initializer` provides a convenience initializer that takes the an optional
URL to the `cacheDb` location to migrate the internal state of the 
`CompactBlockProcessor` and delete that database. 

````Swift
    convenience public init (
        cacheDbURL: URL?,
        fsBlockDbRoot: URL,
        dataDbURL: URL,
        pendingDbURL: URL,
        endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint,
        network: ZcashNetwork,
        spendParamsURL: URL,
        outputParamsURL: URL,
        viewingKeys: [UnifiedFullViewingKey],
        walletBirthday: BlockHeight,
        alias: String = "",
        loggerProxy: Logger? = nil
    )
````

We do not make any efforts to extract the cached blocks in the sqlite
`cacheDb` and storing them on disk. Although this might be the logical 
step to do, we think such migration as little to gain since a migration
function will be a "run once" function with many different scenarios to
consider and possibly very error prone. On the other hand, we rather delete
the `cacheDb` altogether and free up that space on the users' devices since
we have surveyed that the `cacheDb` as been growing exponentially taking up
many gigabyte of disk space. We forsee that many possible attempts to copy
information from one cache to another, would possibly fail 

Consuming block cache information for other purposes is discouraged. Users
must not make assumptions on its contents or rely on its contents in any way. 
Maintainers assume that this state is internal and won't consider further
uses other than the intended for the current development. If you consider
your application needs any other information than the ones available through
public APIs, please file the corresponding feature request.

# Migrating from 0.16.x-beta to 0.17.0-alpha.x

## Changes to Demo APP
The demo application now uses the SDKSynchronizer to create addresses and
shield funds.
`DerivationToolViewController` was removed. See `DerivationTool` unit tests
for sample code.
`GetAddressViewController` now derives transparent and sapling addresses
from Unified Address
`SendViewController` uses Unified Spending Key and type-safe `Memo`

## Changes To SDK
### `CompactBlockProcessor`
`public func getUnifiedAddress(accountIndex: Int) -> UnifiedAddress?`
`public func getSaplingAddress(accountIndex: Int) -> SaplingAddress?` derived from UA
`public func getTransparentAddress(accountIndex: Int) -> TransparentAddress?`
is derived from UA
`public func getTransparentBalance(accountIndex: Int) throws -> WalletBalance` now
fetches from account exclusively
`func refreshUTXOs(tAddress: TransparentAddress, startHeight: BlockHeight) async throws -> RefreshedUTXOs`
uses `TransparentAddress`

### Initializer
Migration of DataDB and CacheDB are delegated to `librustzcash`

removed `public func getAddress(index account: Int = 0) -> String`


### Wallet Types
`UnifiedSpendingKey` to represent Unified Spending Keys. This is a binary
encoded not meant to be stored or backed up. This only serves the purpose
of letting clients use the least privilege keys at all times for every
operation.

### Synchronizer
`sendToAddress` and `shieldFunds` now take a `UnifiedSpendingKey` instead
of the respective spending and transparent private keys.
`refreshUTXOs` uses `TransparentAddress`

### KeyDeriving protocol
Addresses should be obtained from the `Synchronizer` by using the `get_address` functions
Transparent and Sapling receivers should be obtained by extracting the receivers of a UA
````Swift
public extension UnifiedAddress {
    /// Extracts the sapling receiver from this UA if available
    /// - Returns: an `Optional<SaplingAddress>`
    func saplingReceiver() -> SaplingAddress? {
        try? DerivationTool.saplingReceiver(from: self)
    }

    /// Extracts the transparent receiver from this UA if available
    /// - Returns: an `Optional<TransparentAddress>`
    func transparentReceiver() -> TransparentAddress? {
        try? DerivationTool.transparentReceiver(from: self)
    }
````

**Removed**
`func deriveUnifiedFullViewingKeys(seed: [UInt8], numberOfAccounts: Int) throws -> [UnifiedFullViewingKey]`
`func deriveViewingKey(spendingKey: SaplingExtendedSpendingKey) throws -> SaplingExtendedFullViewingKey`
`func deriveSpendingKeys(seed: [UInt8], numberOfAccounts: Int) throws -> [SaplingExtendedSpendingKey]`
`func deriveUnifiedAddress(from ufvk: UnifiedFullViewingKey) throws -> UnifiedAddress`
`func deriveTransparentAddress(seed: [UInt8], account: Int, index: Int) throws -> TransparentAddress`
`func deriveTransparentAccountPrivateKey(seed: [UInt8], account: Int) throws -> TransparentAccountPrivKey`
`func deriveTransparentAddressFromAccountPrivateKey(_ xprv: TransparentAccountPrivKey, index: Int) throws -> TransparentAddress`

**Added**
`static func saplingReceiver(from unifiedAddress: UnifiedAddress) throws -> SaplingAddress?`
`static func transparentReceiver(from unifiedAddress: UnifiedAddress) throws -> TransparentAddress?`
`static func receiverTypecodesFromUnifiedAddress(_ address: UnifiedAddress) throws -> [UnifiedAddress.ReceiverTypecodes]`
`func deriveUnifiedSpendingKey(seed: [UInt8], accountIndex: Int) throws -> UnifiedSpendingKey`
`public func deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey(from spendingKey: UnifiedSpendingKey) throws -> UnifiedFullViewingKey`

## Notes on Structured Concurrency

`CompactBlockProcessor` is now an Swift Actor. This makes it more robust and have its own
async environment.

SDK Clients will likely be affected by some `async` methods on `SDKSynchronizer`.

We recommend clients that don't support structured concurrency features, to work around this by  surrounding the these function calls either in @MainActor contexts either by marking callers as @MainActor or launching tasks on that actor with `Task { @MainActor in ... }`
