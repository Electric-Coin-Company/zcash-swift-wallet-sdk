# 0.16.7-beta
- [#455] revert queue priority downgrade changes from [#435] (#456)
    
This reverts queue priority changes from commit `a5d0e447748257d2af5c9101391dd05a5ce929a2` since we detected it might prevent downloads to be scheduled in a timely fashion

Checkpoints added:

# 0.16.6-beta
- There's a problem with 0.16.5-beta hash. Re-releasing 
# 0.16.5-beta
- [#449] Use CompactBlock Streamer download instead of batch downloads (#451)
This increases the speed of downloads significantly while reducing the memory footprint.
- [#435] thread sanitizer issues (#448)
Issues related to Thread Sanitizer warnings

Also new Checkpoint for 1755000 on mainnet
# 0.16.4-beta
- [#444] Syncing Restarts to zero when the wallet is wiped and synced from zero in one go. (#445)
- [#440] Split constants for Download Batches and Scanning Batches (#441)
This change was done to aleviate memory load when downloading large blocks.
Default download batch constant is deprecated in favor of `DefaultDownloadBatch` and 
`DefaultScanningBatch`
# 0.16.3-beta
 - [#436] Add checkpoint with a lower interval on mainnet (#437)
 This adds checkpoint at a 2500 block interval to help reduce scan times
 on new wallets
# 0.16.2-beta
- [#418] "Swift.EncodingError.InvalidValue Encoding an Int64 is not supported" (#430)
This fixes Cocoapods clients pointing to SQLite 0.12.2 instead of using 0.13
the former does not support custom encoding of Int64 and makes Zatoshi break

- [#428] make some helpers publicly accessible (#429)
# 0.16.1-beta
- [#422] Make Zatoshi extensions of `NSDecimalNumber` public (#423)
- [#419] Fix Unavailable Transport 14 when attempting to sync (#426)
 this changes timeout settings and Keepalive changes. 
 Recommended settings for lightwalletd.com are 60000ms singleCallTimeout
 on `LightWalletEndpoint`
 
- [#416] Update GRPC to 1.8.2 (#421)
# 0.16.0-beta
This version changes the way wallet birthdays are handled.
`WalletBirthday' struct is not longer public and has been renamed
to `Checkpoint`. 

`SynchronizerError` has a default `LocalizedError` compliance to 
help debug errors and display them to the user. This is a workaround
to get rid of cryptic errors that are being reported to maintainers and 
are subject to change in future versions.

- [#392] Synchronizer error 8. when syncing. (#413)
- [#398] Make WalletBirthday an internal type (#414)
- [#411] add Fresh checkpoints for release 0.16.0-beta (#412)
- [#406] some BirthdayTests fail for MacOS target (#410)
- [#404] Configure GRPC KeepAlive according to docs (#409)
# 0.15.1-beta (hotfix)
- [#432] create 0.15.1-beta with SQLite 0.13 
this build is a hotfix for cocoapods. which has the wront SQLite dependency
It moves it from 0.12.2 to 0.13


# 0.15.0-beta
** IMPORTANT ** This version no longer supports iOS 12
We've made a decision to make iOS 13 the minimum deployment target
in order to adopt and support Structured Concurrency and other important features
of the Swift language like Combine. 

- [#363] bump iOS minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0 (#407)
- [#381] Move Zatoshi and Amount Types to the SDK (#396)
This deprecates many methods on `SDKSynchronizer` using Zatoshi for amounts
instead of `Int64`. This exposes number formatters that conveniently provide
decimal conversion from `Zatoshi` to "human-readable" ZEC decimal numbers.

- [#397] Checkpoint format that supports NU5 TreeStates (#399)
`WalletBirthday` now have both `saplingTree` and `orchardTree` values. The
latter being Optional for checkpoints prior to Orchard activation height.

- [#401] DecodingError when refreshing pending transactions (#402)
- [#394] Update swift-grpc to 1.8.0 (#395)

other changes: renamed changelog.md to CHANGELOG.md
# 0.14.0-beta
- [#388] Integrate libzcashlc 0.0.3 to support v5 transaction parsing on NU5 activation
# 0.13.1-beta
- [#326] Load Checkpoint files from bundle.
This is great news! now checkpoints are loaded from files on the bundle instead of
hardcoding them on source files. This will make updates easier, less error prone,
and mostly automatable.
