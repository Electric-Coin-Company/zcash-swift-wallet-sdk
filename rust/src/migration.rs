//! FFI over the final Orchard→Ironwood pool-migration engine
//! ([`zcash_pool_migration`] + the `zcash_client_sqlite::pool_migration` store).
//!
//! The engine is a set of free functions over traits — upstream's own `wallet::WalletMigration`
//! adapter and `zcash_client_sqlite`'s account-scoped store implement them, wired to this SDK's
//! wallet database by [`crate::migration_engine`]'s two constructors
//! ([`account_migration`] for the calls that need a backend and viewing key,
//! [`account_store`] for the ones that are purely store operations);
//! [`crate::migration_finalize`] proves transactions as soon as they become provable (ZIP 374
//! deferred anchors/witnesses, resolved through the upstream prover — transfers against their
//! drawn ZIP 318 boundary anchor, preparations against the wallet's scanned tip; see its module
//! doc), driven by [`zcashlc_migration_prove_transactions`] rather than by the broadcast path;
//! [`crate::migration_plan_cache`] carries the previewed plan from propose to commit.
//! This module keeps the platform-facing C ABI of the v1 integration: the same entry points, the
//! same `#[repr(C)]` DTOs, the same sentinels — the engine swap is absorbed here, with two
//! deliberate exceptions (the external-signer note-split pair went plural, because the engine
//! builds N preparation transactions rather than one split transaction).
//!
//! Semantics that moved into this layer (the v1 crate did them internally):
//! - There is NO derived state machine anymore: [`zcashlc_migration_advance_step`] drives the
//!   engine's public `advance_migration` API and marshals its answer into the stable FFI shape.
//!   `Complete` is
//!   PER-RUN — "the stored run is fully mined (or terminal)", never "nothing left to migrate".
//!   After completion the platform asks `zcashlc_migration_propose_transfers` whether anything
//!   remains (an empty schedule means no).
//! - Mined-ness is DERIVED, never reported: this layer never marks a transaction mined. The
//!   engine promotes every in-flight transaction its scan has seen mine, inside
//!   `advance_migration` — including one whose broadcast THIS process failed to record, which it
//!   identifies by the id stored on the row. The read-only entry points ask the same question
//!   through [`reconcile_mined`], so a standalone read is not answered from a state the scan has
//!   already moved past.
//! - Node rejection is recorded as testimony via `report_broadcast_failure`; the sqlite-backed
//!   satisfiability oracle adjudicates it after sufficient scanning and independently discovers
//!   scan-visible spends. The SDK makes no invalidity determination of its own: it has no way to
//!   date a verdict against the scanned region, so a reorg could never withdraw one. (Earlier
//!   versions kept an SDK-owned `ext_zcashlc_orchard_ironwood_migration_invalid_marks` side table
//!   the engine could not consult; [`migrate_legacy_invalid_marks`] folds any surviving rows into
//!   the engine state once, on open, and drops the table.)
//! - The immediate lane (an ordinary send-max sweep, entirely outside the engine) is tracked in
//!   its own SDK-owned `sdk_immediate_runs` side table and surfaces ONLY through
//!   [`zcashlc_migration_progress`]: while unmined it reports a 0-of-1 progress snapshot (flagged
//!   `is_immediate`); once mined or expired it reports nothing. See that function's contract.
//!
//! Consent contract: plan details never cross the FFI boundary inward. Each propose/prepare call
//! caches its plan under an opaque [`migration_plan_cache::PlanHandle`] (returned to the platform
//! as the proposal DTO's `proposal_handle` field, `0` reserved for "no cached plan"), and the
//! commit functions take ONLY that handle back — `commit_or_resume`/`migration_plan_cache` then
//! sign exactly the identified plan, or fail with `MIGRATION_PLAN_STALE` when it is missing
//! (process restart) or superseded (a later propose replaced what the platform displayed). This
//! replaces the earlier "verified consent echo" (F4) contract, which had the platform echo the
//! displayed schedule fields back for comparison against a byte-for-byte reproduction of the
//! preview DTO; the handle identifies the plan object itself, covering every field (including
//! ones the DTO never displayed) with none of the echo path's reproduce-exactly bookkeeping.
//!
//! Error channel: failures land in the thread-local last-error message. Three stable prefixes let
//! the Swift layer surface dedicated errors: `MIGRATION_PLAN_STALE:` (commit whose handle does
//! not identify the currently cached proposal — re-propose), `MIGRATION_PROVING_UNAVAILABLE:`
//! (proving failed hard), and `MIGRATION_WAKEUP_INFEASIBLE:<id>` (a stored transfer admits no
//! valid sync wake-up height — see [`zcashlc_migration_sync_wakeups`]). Pointer-returning
//! functions yield NULL on error, `bool`-returning functions `false`, and the `i64` sentinels are
//! documented per function.
//!
//! Heap ownership: every function that returns a `*mut Ffi*` (or a [`crate::ffi::BoxedSlice`])
//! transfers ownership to the caller, who must free it with the matching
//! `zcashlc_free_migration_*` (or `zcashlc_free_boxed_slice`) function.

// ----- estimated-tip due-ness (M2, upstream `DuenessTargets`) -----
//
// `zcashlc_migration_has_overdue_transfers` and `zcashlc_migration_advance_step` accept an
// OPTIONAL estimated chain tip (a wall-clock projection past the scanned tip, computed by the
// platform from `zcashlc_migration_block_rate_samples`). The estimate/scanned split is OWNED
// UPSTREAM now:
// `zcash_pool_migration::state::DuenessTargets` encodes the rule (the estimate may only
// ACCELERATE schedule due-ness; expiry, boundary settledness, and every destructive decision
// evaluate on the scanned target — plus the doomed-broadcast withhold, where an expiry the
// EFFECTIVE target has passed keeps a broadcast from being served without ever counting as
// expired), and the public transaction-status and advance APIs evaluate it. This module only
// converts the FFI's `estimated_tip: i64` into the estimated-target side of
// [`DuenessTargets::new`] — see [`dueness_targets`].
//
// WHICH ROW is next is upstream's call too, not just the heights it is judged against, and among
// the ACTION lanes it is the CONDUIT's alone to ask: [`zcashlc_migration_advance_step`] cranks
// [`drive_advance`], and the two executors — [`zcashlc_migration_take_broadcast_transaction`] and
// [`zcashlc_migration_prove_transactions`] — discharge the instruction it returned without asking
// again (a due broadcast outranks proving exactly as the engine documents, and that precedence is
// therefore decided once, in the advance). The READ-ONLY REPORTING query — [`due_assuming_proving`],
// behind [`zcashlc_migration_has_overdue_transfers`] — cannot drive anything (it opens a read-only
// connection and must not mutate), so it reads the engine's public PER-ROW status view,
// `MigrationState::transaction_statuses`. That view agrees with the kernel's queues by
// construction: `ready && action == Broadcast` holds exactly when `advance_migration` would offer
// the broadcast, and the doomed-broadcast withhold is rendered as neither ready nor actionable.
// What that query does compose here is the ORDER among several actionable rows — the
// `(scheduled_height, id)`-min re-derived in [`due_assuming_proving`] — which is the module's one
// accepted drift risk (recorded on librustzcash #2938, 2026-08-06); and being unverified, a
// display read can still disagree with what the drive, having consulted the store's oracle, would
// actually serve.

///    `(scheduled_height, id)`-min among rows reported `ready` with [`NextAction::Prove`] whose
///    schedule the effective target has already reached. Prove-readiness arrives long before the
///    broadcast window — that head start is the whole point of the prove/broadcast split — so an

/// ONE PASS PER TIER suffices, with no virtual-prove closure to drive and no scratch clone to

/// cannot make any OTHER row actionable. The transitive "once every proof exists" answer is
/// therefore exactly these two filters over the statuses as they already stand.
///
/// The per-row predicates are upstream's by construction: a row is `ready` with
/// [`NextAction::Broadcast`] exactly when the drive would offer its broadcast, and a
/// doomed-broadcast withhold ([`Blocker::ExpiryImminent`]) is reported as neither `ready` nor
/// carrying an action, so this query honours the withhold without restating it. What is RE-DERIVED
/// here, the queues themselves not being exported, is the ORDER within each tier — the
/// `(scheduled_height, id)`-min — which is this module's accepted drift risk, recorded on
/// librustzcash #2938 (2026-08-06).
///
/// ADVISORY, exactly as the exported queue reads it replaces were: a status carries no
/// store-oracle verification. [`zcashlc_migration_advance_step`] is the verified drive, which puts

/// (a slot that sits BETWEEN the two tiers above, preempting proving but not a due broadcast) this
/// query still names a row while the delivery lane has nothing to serve, a divergence by design.
/// What this DOES separate, for the display query built on it
/// ([`zcashlc_migration_has_overdue_transfers`]), is "nothing is due" from "due, but its proof has
