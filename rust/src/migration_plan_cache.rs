//! In-process cache of the most recent [`MigrationPlan`] per `(database, account)`, bridging the
//! gap between `plan_migration()` (a pure, unpersisted preview) and the commit functions
//! (`commit_preparation`/`build_preparation_unsigned`) that must sign that exact plan value later.
//!
//! Every cached plan is identified by an opaque, randomly drawn [`PlanHandle`], returned to the
//! platform inside the proposal DTOs (`FfiNoteSplitProposal::proposal_handle` /
//! `FfiMigrationSchedule::proposal_handle`). A commit call passes the handle back, and [`get`]
//! refuses to release a plan under any other handle — so a commit can only ever sign the exact
//! plan the platform displayed, never one that a later propose/prepare call happened to cache in
//! the meantime (ZIP 318's scheduling draws fresh randomness on every `plan_migration()` call, so
//! two plans essentially never agree even over unchanged wallet state). The handle gate replaces
//! the earlier field-by-field "verified consent echo" (F4) contract: instead of the platform
//! echoing schedule values back for comparison against a byte-for-byte reproduction of the
//! preview DTO, plan details now never cross the FFI boundary inward at all.
//!
//! This is deliberately NOT persisted: the engine's `MigrationPlan` (and its `DenominationPlan`/
//! `PreparationPlan` fields) has no `serde` support and no public constructor — the only way to
//! obtain one is calling `plan_migration()` itself — so it cannot round-trip through our own
//! storage. It lives in a process-lifetime static instead, which matches the app's flow: the
//! whole "review a migration proposal, then confirm it" sequence happens in one app-process
//! lifetime. If the process is killed between propose and confirm, the commit path surfaces the
//! stable `MIGRATION_PLAN_STALE` error (mapped to `ZcashError.migrationPlanStale` in Swift) so
//! the app re-proposes, rather than silently recomputing a fresh, differently-randomized plan the
//! user never saw or approved.
