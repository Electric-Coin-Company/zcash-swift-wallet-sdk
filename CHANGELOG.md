### [#959] and [#914] Value of outbound transactions does not match user intended tx input 

This change switches to a new (future) version of the rust crates that will get rid of the sent and received transactions Views in favor of a v_transaction view that will do better accounting of outgoing and incoming funds. Additionally it will support an outputs view for seeing the inner details of transactions enabling the SDKs tell the users the precise movement of value that a tx causes in its multiple possible ways according to the protocol.

the v_tx_outputs view is not yet implemented.

Sent and Received transaction sub-types are kept for compatibility purposes but they are generated from Overviews instead of queried from a specific view.

In the transaction Overview the value represents the whole value transfer for the transaction from the point of view of a given account including fees. This means that the value for a single transaction Overview struct represents the addition or subtraction of ZEC value to the account's balance.

Future updates will give clients the possibility to drill into the inner workings of those value changes in a per-output basis for each transaction.

Also, the field pending_unmined field was added to v_transactions so that wallets can query DataDb for pending but yet unmined txs

This will prepare the field for removing the notion of a "PendingDb" and its nuances.

### [#888] Updates to layer between Swift and Rust

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

`KeyDeriving` protocol is changed. And therefore `DerivationTool` is changed. `deriveUnifiedSpendingKey(seed:accountIndex:)` and
`deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey(from:)` methods are now async. `DerivationTool` offers alternatives for these methods. Alternatives are using either
closures or Combine. 

### [#469] ZcashRustBackendWelding to Async

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

These methods previously returned Optional and now those methods return non-optional value and those methods can an throw error:
- `getSaplingAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> SaplingAddress`
- `func getUnifiedAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> UnifiedAddress`
- `func getTransparentAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> TransparentAddress`

These methods are now async:
- `func getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`
- `func getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`

`Initializer` no longer have methods to get balance. Use `SDKSynchronizer` (or it's alternative APIs) to get balance.

### Deprecations made effective:
Synchronizer
- `func getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int) -> Int64`
- `func getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int) -> Int64`
use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an
Int64 value.

Initializer:
- `func getBalance(account index: Int = 0) -> Int64`
use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an
Int64 value.
- `func getVerifiedBalance(account index: Int = 0) -> Int64`
use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an
Int64 value.

ZcashSDK.NetworkConstants:
- `func defaultFee(for height: BlockHeight) -> Int64`
use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an
Int64 value.

ZcashRustBackendWelding:
- `func getReceivedMemoAsUTF8(dbData:idNote:networkType:) -> String?`
 Use `getReceivedMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead
- `func getSentMemoAsUTF8(dbData:idNote:networkType:) -> String?`
 Use `getSentMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead

### [#209] Support Initializer Aliases

Added `ZcashSynchronizerAlias` enum which is used to identify an instance of the `SDKSynchronizer`. All the paths
to all resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are updated automatically inside the SDK according to the 
alias. So it's safe to create multiple instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`. Each instance must have unique Alias. If 
the `default` alias is used then the SDK works the same as before this change was introduced.

The SDK now also checks which aliases are used and it prevents situations when two instances of the `SDKSynchronizer` 
has the same alias. Methods `prepare()` and `wipe()` do checks for used alias. And those methods fail
with `InitializerError.aliasAlreadyInUse` if the alias is already used.

If the alias check fails in the `prepare()` method then the status of the `SDKSynchronizer` isn't switched from `unprepared`. 
These methods newly throw `SynchronizerError.notPrepared` error when the status is `unprepared`:
- `sendToAddress(spendingKey:zatoshi:toAddress:memo:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `shieldFundsspendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `latestUTXOs(address:) async throws -> [UnspentTransactionOutputEntity]`
- `refreshUTXOs(address:from:) async throws -> RefreshedUTXOs`
- `rewind(policy:) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error>`

Provided file URLs to resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are now parsed inside the SDK and updated 
according to the alias. If some error during this happens then `SDKSynchronzer.prepare()` method throws 
`InitializerError.cantUpdateURLWithAlias` error.

### [#831] Add support for alternative APIs

There are two new protocols (`ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer`). And there are two new 
objects which conform to respective protocols (`ClosureSDKSynchronizer` and `CombineSDKSynchronizer`). These
new objects offer alternative API for the `SDKSynchronizer`. Now the client app can choose which technology 
it wants to use to communicate with Zcash SDK and it isn't forced to use async.

These methods in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `prepare(with:viewingKeys:walletBirthday:)`
- `start(retry:)`
- `stop()`
- `cancelSpend(transaction:)`
- All the variants of the `getMemos(for:)` method.
- All the variants fo the `getRecipients(for:)` method.
- `allConfirmedTransactions(from:limit:)`

These properties in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `pendingTransactions`
- `clearedTransactions`
- `sentTransactions`
- `receivedTransactions`

Non async `SDKsynchronizer.latestHeight(result:)` were moved to `ClosureSDKSynchronizer`.

### [#724] Switch from event based notifications to state based notifications

The `SDKSynchronizer` no longer uses `NotificationCenter` to send notifications.
Notifications are replaced with `Combine` publishers. Check the migrating document and
documentation in the code to get more information.

### [#826] Change how the SDK is initialized
    
- `viewingKeys` and `walletBirthday` are removed from `Initializer` constuctor. These parameters moved to 
`SDKSynchronizer.prepare` function.
- Constructor of the `SDKSynchronizer` no longer throws exception.
- Any value emitted from `lastState` stream before `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` is called has `latestScannedHeight` set to 0.
- `Initializer.initialize` function isn't public anymore. To initialize SDK call `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` 
instead.

## Fixed
### [#821] `failedToWriteMetadata` at sync startup
contains no public API changes.
Adds `func shouldClearBlockCacheAndUpdateInternalState() -> BlockHeight?` to `SyncRanges`
so that the compact block processor can advert internal states that are not consistent and
recover from such state. 

For concrete examples check out the tests in:
`Tests/NetworkTests/CompactBlockProcessorTests.swift`


## Deleted
Removed linter binary from repository

# 0.19.0-beta
### [#816] Improve how rewind call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.rewind(policy:)` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the rewind is done. For more details read the documentation for this method 
in the code.

### [#801] Improve how wipe call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.wipe()` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the wipe is done. For more details read the documentation for this method 
in the code.

### [#793] Send synchronizerStopped notification only when sync process stops
    
`synchronizerStopped` notification is now sent after the sync process stops. It's
not sent right when `stop()` method is called.

### [#795] Include sapling-spend file into bundle for tests
    
This is only an internal change and doesn't change the behavior of the SDK. `Initializer`'s
constructor has a new parameter `saplingParamsSourceURL`. Use `SaplingParamsSourceURL.default` 
value for this parameter.

### [#764] Refactor communication between components inside th SDK

This is mostly an internal change. A consequence of this change is that all the notifications
delivered via `NotificationCenter` with the prefix `blockProcessor` are now gone. If affected
notifications were used in your code use notifications with the prefix `synchronizer` now. 
These notifications are defined in `SDKSynchronizer.swift`.

### [#759] Remove Jazz-generated HTML docs

We remove these documents since they are outdated and we rely on the docs in the code itself.

### [#726] Modularize GRPC layer

This is mostly internal change. `LightWalletService` is no longer public. If it
is used in your code replace it by using `SDKSynchronizer` API.

### [#770] Update GRPC swift library
This updates to GRPC-Swift 1.14.0.

## File system backed block cache

File system based block cache. Compact blocks will now be stored
on the file system. Caller must provide a `URL` pointing to the 
filesystem root directory where the fsBlock cache is. this directory
is expected to contain a `/blocks` sub-directory with the blocks stored
in the convened filename format `{height}-{hash}-compactblock`. This directory
must be granted both read and write permissions.

the file system cache will have a "bookkeeping" database that the rust
welding layer will use to know the state of the cache and locate the 
cached compact blocks. This directory can be deleted provided that the
Compactblock processor or Synchronizer are not running. Upon deletion 
caller is responsible for initializing these objects for the cache to 
be created. 

Implementation notes: Users of the SDK will know the path they will 
provide but must assume no behavior whatsoever or rely on the cached 
information in any way, since it is an internal state of the SDK. 
Maintainers might provide no support for problems related to speculative
use of the file system cache. If you consider your application needs any
other information than the one available through public APIs, please 
file the corresponding feature request.

### Added

- `Synchronizer.shieldFunds(spendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold)` shieldingThreshold
was added allowing wallets to manage their own shielding policies.
    
### Removed
- `InitializerError.cacheDbMigrationFailed`

### Deprecations
CacheDb references that were deprecated instead of **deleted** are pointing out
that they should be useful for you to migrate from using cacheDb.

- `ResourceProvider.cacheDbURL` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients 
to move away from cacheDb.

- `NetworkConstants.defaultCacheDbName` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients 
to move away from cacheDb.

## Farewell Cocoapods.
### [#612] Remove Support for Cocoapods (#706)

It wouldn't have been possible to release an SDK without you, pal.

We are moving away from Cocoapods since our main dependencies, SwiftGRPC
and SWIFT-NIO are. We don't have much of a choice. 

We've been communicating this for a long time. Although, if you really need Cocoapods,
please let us know by opening an issue in our repo and we'll talk about it.

## Bugfixes

### [#645] Default rewind after ReOrg is 20 blocks when it should be 10
This fixes an issue where the default reorg was 20 blocks rewind instead of 10. The
reorg count was incremented before calling the rewind height computing function.

## Use Librustzcash database views to query and represent transactions
 
### [#556] Change data structures which represent transactions.

These data types are gone: `Transaction`, `TransactionEntity`, `ConfirmedTransaction`, 
`ConfirmedTransactionEntity`. And these data types were added: `ZcashTransaction.Overview`, 
`ZcashTransaction.Received`, `ZcashTransaction.Sent`. 

New data structures are very similar to the old ones. Although there many breaking changes.
The APIs of the `SDKSynchronizer` remain unchanged in their behavior. They return different 
data types. **When adopting this change, you should check which data types are used by methods 
of the `SDKSynchronizer` in your code and change them accordingly.**

New transaction structures no longer have a `memo` property. This responds to the fact that 
Zcash transactions can have either none or multiple memos. To get memos for the transaction 
the `SDKSynchronizer` has now new methods to fetch those:
- `func getMemos(for transaction: ZcashTransaction.Overview) throws -> [Memo]`, 
- `func getMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received) throws -> [Memo]`
- `func getMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent) throws -> [Memo]`
    
## CompactBlockProcessor is now internal
### [#671] Make CompactBlockProcessor Internal.

The CompactBlockProcessor is no longer a public class/API. Any direct access will
end up as a compiler error. Recommended way how to handle things is via `SDKSynchronizer`
from now on. The Demo app has been updated accordingly as well.

## We've changed how we download and scan blocks. Status reporting has changed.

### [#657] Change how blocks are downloaded and scanned. 

In previous versions, the SDK first downloaded all the blocks and then it
scanned all the blocks. This approach requires a lot of disk space. The SDK now 
behaves differently. It downloads a batch of blocks (100 by default), scans those, and
removes those blocks from the disk. And repeats this until all the blocks are processed.

`SyncStatus` was changed. `.downloading`, `.validating`, and `.scanning` symbols
were removed. And the `.scanning` symbol was added. The removed phases of the sync 
process are now reported as one phase. 

Notifications were also changed similarly. These notifications were
removed: `SDKSynchronizerDownloading`, `SDKSyncronizerValidating`, and `SDKSyncronizerScanning`.
And the `SDKSynchronizerSyncing` notification was added. The added notification replaces
the removed notifications.
        
## New Wipe Method to delete wallet information. Use with care. 
### [#677] Add support for wallet wipe into SDK. Add new method `Synchronizer.wipe()`. 

## Benchmarking APIs: A primer
### [#663] Foundations for the benchmarking/performance testing in the SDK. 

This change presents 2 building blocks for the future automated tests, consisting
of a new SDKMetrics interface to control flow of the data in the SDK and 
new performance (unit) test measuring synchronization of 100 mainnet blocks.

### [#646] SDK sync process resumes to previously saved block height
This change adds an internal storage test on UserDefaults that tells the 
SDK where sync was left off when cancelled whatever the reason for it
to restart on a later attempt. This fixes some issues around syncing
long block ranges in several attempts not enhancing the right transactions
because the enhancing phase would only consider the last range scanned.
This only fixes the situation where rewinding the SDK would cause the 
whole database to be cleared instead and syncing to be restarted from 
scratch (issue [#660]).

### [#532] [0.16.x-beta] Download does not stop correctly

Issue Reported:

When the synchronizer is stopped, the processor does not cancel
the download correctly. Then when attempting to resume sync, the
synchronizer is not on `.stopped` and can't be resumed

this doesn't appear to happen in `master` branch that uses
structured concurrency for operations.

Fix:
This commit makes sure that the download streamer checks cancelation
before processing any block, or getting called back to report progress

# 0.16.6-beta
- There's a problem with 0.16.5-beta hash. Re-releasing 
# 0.16.5-beta
- [#449] Use CompactBlock Streamer download instead of batch downloads (#451)
This increases the speed of downloads significantly while reducing the memory footprint.
- [#435] thread sanitizer issues (#448)
Issues related to Thread Sanitizer warnings

Also new Checkpoint for 1755000 on mainnet

- [#444] Syncing Restarts to zero when the wallet is wiped and synced from zero in one go. (#445)
- [#440] Split constants for Download Batches and Scanning Batches (#441)
This change was done to aleviate memory load when downloading large blocks.
Default download batch constant is deprecated in favor of `DefaultDownloadBatch` and 
`DefaultScanningBatch`
# 0.16.3-beta
 - [#436] Add checkpoint with a lower interval on mainnet (#437)
 This adds checkpoint at a 2500 block interval to help reduce scan times
 on new wallets
# 0.16.2-beta
- [#418] "Swift.EncodingError.InvalidValue Encoding an Int64 is not supported" (#430)
This fixes Cocoapods clients pointing to SQLite 0.12.2 instead of using 0.13
the former does not support custom encoding of Int64 and makes Zatoshi break

- [#428] make some helpers publicly accessible (#429)
# 0.16.1-beta
- [#422] Make Zatoshi extensions of `NSDecimalNumber` public (#423)
- [#419] Fix Unavailable Transport 14 when attempting to sync (#426)
 this changes timeout settings and Keepalive changes. 
 Recommended settings for lightwalletd.com are 60000ms singleCallTimeout
 on `LightWalletEndpoint`
 
- [#416] Update GRPC to 1.8.2 (#421)
# 0.16.0-beta
This version changes the way wallet birthdays are handled.
`WalletBirthday' struct is not longer public and has been renamed
to `Checkpoint`. 

`SynchronizerError` has a default `LocalizedError` compliance to 
help debug errors and display them to the user. This is a workaround
to get rid of cryptic errors that are being reported to maintainers and 
are subject to change in future versions.

- [#392] Synchronizer error 8. when syncing. (#413)
- [#398] Make WalletBirthday an internal type (#414)
- [#411] add Fresh checkpoints for release 0.16.0-beta (#412)

# 0.15.1-beta (hotfix)
- [#432] create 0.15.1-beta with SQLite 0.13 
this build is a hotfix for cocoapods. which has the wront SQLite dependency
It moves it from 0.12.2 to 0.13


# 0.15.0-beta
** IMPORTANT ** This version no longer supports iOS 12
We've made a decision to make iOS 13 the minimum deployment target
in order to adopt and support Structured Concurrency and other important features
of the Swift language like Combine. 

- [#363] bump iOS minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0 (#407)
- [#381] Move Zatoshi and Amount Types to the SDK (#396)
This deprecates many methods on `SDKSynchronizer` using Zatoshi for amounts
instead of `Int64`. This exposes number formatters that conveniently provide
decimal conversion from `Zatoshi` to "human-readable" ZEC decimal numbers.

- [#397] Checkpoint format that supports NU5 TreeStates (#399)
`WalletBirthday` now have both `saplingTree` and `orchardTree` values. The
latter being Optional for checkpoints prior to Orchard activation height.

- [#401] DecodingError when refreshing pending transactions (#402)
- [#394] Update swift-grpc to 1.8.0 (#395)

other changes: renamed changelog.md to CHANGELOG.md
# 0.14.0-beta
- [#388] Integrate libzcashlc 0.0.3 to support v5 transaction parsing on NU5 activation
# 0.13.1-beta
- [#326] Load Checkpoint files from bundle.
This is great news! now checkpoints are loaded from files on the bundle instead of
hardcoding them on source files. This will make updates easier, less error prone,
and mostly automatable.
