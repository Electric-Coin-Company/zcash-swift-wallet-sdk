# Changelog
All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this library adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

# Unreleased

## Added
- Custom SQL functions to `Synchronizer.debugDatabase`:
  - `txid(Blob) -> String`: converts a transaction ID from its byte form to a user-facing string.
  - `memo(Blob?) -> String?`: prints the given blob as a string if it is a text memo, and as hex-encoded bytes otherwise.

- `SDKSynchronizer.estimateTimestamp(for height: Blockheight)`: Get an estimated timestamp for a given block height.

- `SDKSynchronizer.enhanceTransactionBy(id)` Calls an enhance action for a given txId.

## Fixed
- The Sapling parameter files download logic replaces the files atomically rather than moving them into the final destination. This prevents errors caused by partially downloaded files.

# 2.4.0 - 2025-11-10

## Added
- `SDKSynchronizer.getSingleUseTransparentAddress` Get an ephemeral single use transparent address.
- `SDKSynchronizer.checkSingleUseTransparentAddresses` Checks to find any single-use ephemeral addresses exposed in the past day that have not yet received funds, excluding any whose next check time is in the future. This will then choose the address that is most overdue for checking, retrieve any UTXOs for that address over Tor, and add them to the wallet database. 
- `SDKSynchronizer.updateTransparentAddressTransactions` Finds all transactions associated with the given transparent address.
- `SDKSynchronizer.fetchUTXOsBy(address)` Checks to find any UTXOs associated with the given transparent address. This check will cover the block range starting at the exposure height for that address, if known, or otherwise at the birthday height of the specified account.

## Fixed
- [2.3.6 change] Transparent funds are now reported after `UpdateChainTipAction` is processed. Attempt to shield before this action has been failing otherwise. Update: the solution handled only cold start of a client, now it resets the logic with each stop() call of the SDK.
- Updated to zcash_client_sqlite-0.18.9 to fix problems in transparent UTXO selection for shielding, including incorrect handling of outputs received at ephemeral addresses and selection of dust transparent outputs for shielding.

# 2.3 - 2025-08-05

## Removed
- `latencyThresholdMillis` parameter was removed from `Synchronizer.evaluateBestOf()` method. The algorithm of servers evaluation was changed to always require `kServers` to be returned.

## Updated

## Added
- `func tor(enabled: Bool)` A function that allows clients to configure Tor usage for lwd and http calls.
- `func exchangeRateOverTor(enabled: Bool)` A function that allows clients to configure Tor usage for exchange rate.
- `func isTorSuccessfullyInitialized() async -> Bool?` A function that returns the result of the TorClient initialization. A nil value indicates that initialization has not been initiated. True/false represents success or failure, respectively.
- `ZcashTransaction.Overview state` that holds information whether the transaction has been confirmed or expired or is still pending.

## Fixed

### [#1482] Fix the wipe function
- An occasional error occurred after the wipe function was called due to a missing termination of the timer. The next trigger caused the compact block processor to run again, but without any database in place, resulting in a “no such table: accounts” error.

# 2.2.8 - 2025-01-10

## Added
- `SDKSynchronizer.listAccounts` Returns a list of the accounts in the wallet.
- `SDKSynchronizer.importAccount` Imports a new account for unified full viewing key.
- `SDKSynchronizer.createPCZTFromProposal` Creates a partially-created (unsigned without proofs) transaction from the given proposal.
- `SDKSynchronizer.addProofsToPCZT` Adds proofs to the given PCZT
- `SDKSynchronizer.createTransactionFromPCZT` Takes a PCZT that has been separately proven and signed, finalizes it, and stores it in the wallet. Internally, this logic also submits and checks the newly stored and encoded transaction.

## Changed
- `zcashlc_propose_transfer`, `zcashlc_propose_transfer_from_uri` and `zcashlc_propose_shielding` no longer accpt a `use_zip317_fees` parameter; ZIP 317 standard fees are now always used and are not configurable.
- The SDK no longer assumes a default account. All business logic with instances of Zip32AccountIndex(<index>) has been refactored.
- `SDKSynchronizer.getAccountBalance -> AccountBalance?` into `SDKSynchronizer.getAccountsBalances -> [AccountUUID: AccountBalance]`

## Removed
- `SDKSynchronizer.sendToAddress`, deprecated in 2.1
- `SDKSynchronizer.shieldFunds`, deprecated in 2.1

  occasionally reporting scan progress values greater than 100%.

# 2.2.4 - 2024-10-07

## Fixed
- This release fixes a potential source of corruption in wallet note commitment
  trees related to incorrect handling of chain reorgs. It includes a database
  migration that will repair the corrupted database state of any wallet
  affected by this corner case.

# 2.2.1 - 2024-08-21

## Fixed
- This release fixes an error in database migration logic that could cause problems
  when upgrading certain wallets from versions in the 2.1.x range.

# 2.2.0 - 2024-08-20

## Added
- `Synchronizer.exchangeRateUSDStream: AnyPublisher<FiatCurrencyResult?, Never>`,
  which returns the currently-cached USD/ZEC exchange rate, or `nil` if it has not yet been
  fetched.
- `Synchronizer.refreshExchangeRateUSD()`, which refreshes the rate returned by
  `Synchronizer.exchangeRateUSDStream`. Prices are queried over Tor (to hide the wallet's
  IP address).

## Changed

### [#1475] Adopt transaction data requests

# 2.1.7 - 2024-05-16

## Changed
- `minimumShieldingConfirmations` set to 1 instead of 10. This should fasten the time it takes to swap transparent funds to shielded ones.

# 2.1.6 - 2024-05-15

## Fixed
- The backend method proposeShielding checks the pointer for a null value before attempting to construct the Data with it. Without this check, proposeShielding would crash when there were either zero funds to shield or when the amount was less than the threshold defined by the client.

# 2.1.5 - 2024-04-18

## Changed
- Updated to `zcash-light-client-ffi` version 0.8.0. This includes a migration to
  ensure that the default Unified Address for existing wallets contains an Orchard
  receiver.
- This release includes a workaround for build and deployment issues related to
  a bug in XCode 15.3.

# 2.1.4 - 2024-04-17

## Changed
- The database locking mechanism has been changed to use async/await concurrency approach - the DBActor.

## Changed
- Migrated to `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.6.0`.

### [#1186] Enable ZIP 317 fees
- The SDK now generates transactions using [ZIP 317](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317) fees,
  instead of a fixed fee of 10,000 Zatoshi. Use `Proposal.totalFeeRequired` to check the
  total fee for a transfer before creating it.

## Added

### [#1204] Expose APIs for working with transaction proposals
New `Synchronizer` APIs that enable constructing a proposal for transferring or
shielding funds, and then creating transactions from a proposal. The intermediate
proposal can be used to determine the required fee, before committing to producing
transactions.

The old `Synchronizer.sendToAddress` and `Synchronizer.shieldFunds` APIs have been
deprecated, and will be removed in 2.1.0 (which will create multiple transactions
at once for some recipients).

# 2.0.10 - 2024-02-12

## Added

### [#1153] Allow runtime switch of lightwalletd servers
New API implemented that allows clients to change the `mainnet` endpoint. Use `func switchTo(endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint) async throws`.
Possible errors:
- `ZcashError.synchronizerServerSwitch` will perform a check to ensure that it's possible to communicate with the specified lightwalletd server, which may result in an an error. If this check fails, the user should be prompted to check the address, port and verify that the `address:port` format is respected.
- Switching endpoints causes a call to `synchronizer.Start()`, which may throw a `ZcashError`.

## Changed

### [#1369] SynchronizerState refactor and balances cleanup
`SynchronizerState` cleaned up and changed to provide only `AccountBalance`. This struct holds `saplingBalance: PoolBalance` which represents shielded balance for both total and spendable. Also holds `unshielded: Zatoshi` which represents transparent balance.

## Removed

### [#1369] SynchronizerState refactor and balances cleanup
- `WalletBalance` has been removed from the SDK, replaced with `AccountBalance`.
- `getTransparentBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead
- `getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead
- `getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int)`, use `getAccountBalance(accountIndex: Int = 0)` instead

# 2.0.9 - 2024-01-31

## Changed

### [#1363] Account balances in the SynchronizerState
`shieldedBalance: WalletBalance` has been replaced with `accountBalances: AccountBalance`. `AccountBalance` provides the same values as `shieldedBalance` but adds up a pending changes. Under the hood this calls rust's `getWalletSummary` which improved also the syncing initial values of % and balances.

## Added

### [#1153] Allow runtime switch of lightwalletd servers
New API implemented that allows clients to change the `mainnet` endpoint. Use `func switchTo(endpoint: LightWalletEndpoint) async throws`.
Possible errors:
- `ZcashError.synchronizerServerSwitch`: endpoint fails, check the address, port and format address:port,
- Some `ZcashError` related to `synchronizer.Start()`: the switch calls `start()` at the end and that is the only throwing function except the validation.

# 2.0.8 - 2024-01-30

Adopt `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.5.1`. This fixes a serialization problem
broke shielding.

# 2.0.7 - 2024-01-29

## Added
- `Model.ScanSummary`
- `Model.WalletSummary.{PoolBalance, AccountBalance, WalletSummary}`

## Changed
- The `ZcashError` type has changed.
  - Added variant `rustGetWalletSummary`
  - Removed variants:

    - `rustGetScanProgress` (expect `rustGetWalletSummary` instead)

- The performance of `getWalletSummary` and `scanBlocks` have been improved.

# 2.0.6 - 2024-01-28

## Changed

### [#1346] Troubleshooting synchronization
We focused on performance of the synchronization and found out a root cause in progress reporting. Simple change reduced the synchronization significantly by reporting less frequently. This affect the UX a bit because the % of the sync is updated only every 500 scanned blocks instead of every 100. Proper solution is going to be handled in #1353.

### [#1351] Recover from block stream issues
Async block stream grpc calls sometimes fail with unknown error 14, most of the times represented as `Transport became inactive` or `NIOHTTP2.StreamClosed`. Unless the service is truly down, these errors are usually false positive ones. The SDK was able to recover from this error with the next sync triggered but it takes 10-30s to happen. This delay is unnecessary so we made 2 changes. When these errors are caught the next sync is triggered immediately (at most 3 times) + the error state is not passed to the clients.

## Changed
The `SDKMetrics` logs data using os_log. The public API `enableMetrics()` and `disableMetrics()` no longer exist. All metrics are automatically logged for every sync run. Extraction of the metrics is up to the client/dev - done by using `OSLogStore`.

## Added

### [#1325] Log metrics
The sync process is measured and detailed metrics are logged for every sync run. The data are logged using os_log so any client can export it. Verbose logs are under `sdkLogs_default` category, `default` level. Sync specific logs use `error` level.

# 2.0.3 - 2023-10-20

## Fixed

### [#1308] Enhancing seems to not process all ranges
The enhancing of the transactions now processes all the blocks suggested by scan ranges. The issue was that when new scan ranges were suggested the value that drives the enhancing range computation wasn't reset, so when higher ranges were processed, the lower ranges were skipped. This fix ensures all transaction data are properly set, as well as fixing eventStream `.foundTransaction` reporting.

### Fix incorrect note deduplication in v_transactions (librustzcash)
This is a fix in the rust layer. The amount sent in the transaction was incorrectly reported even though the actual amount was sent properly. Now clients should see the amount they expect to see in the UI.

# 2.0.2 - 2023-10-12

## Changed

### [#1303] Don't invalidate the timer with the error
The SDK has some simple logic of retrying when some erros occurs. There were 5 attempts of retry until the SDK stopped the synchronization process completely. (The timer is not restarted after those). That approach led to some annoying UX issue of manually starting the SDKSynchronizer from the client, shifting the responsibility to the devs/clients. This has been changed, the SDK never stops the timer unless `synchronizer.stop()` is called.

## Fixed

### [#1301] foundTransactions don't emit after rewind
The `.foundTransactions` observed on eventStream worked well during the sync until the rewind was called. That API missed reset of the ActionContext in the CompactBlockProcesser and that led to never observing the same transactions again. This ticket fixed the problem, reset is called in the rewind and new sync passes the transactions to the stream.

# 2.0.1 - 2023-10-03

## Changed

### [#1294] Remove all uses of the incorrect 1000-ZAT fee
The 1000 Zatoshi fee proposed in ZIP-313 is deprecated now and so the minimum is 10k Zatoshi, defined in ZIP-317.
The SDK has been cleaned up from deprecated fee but note, real fee is handled in a rust layer.
The public API `NetworkConstants.defaultFee(for: BlockHeight)` has been refactored to `NetworkConstants.defaultFee()`.

# 2.0.0 - 2023-09-25

## Notable Changes

This release updates `ZcashLightClientKit` to implement the Spend-Before-Sync fast
synchronization algorithm.

## Changed

Updated dependencies:
- `zcash-light-client-ffi 0.4.0`

`CompactBlockProcessor` now processes compact blocks from the lightwalletd server with Spend-before-Sync algorithm (i.e. non-linear order). This feature shortens the time after which a wallet's spendable balance can be used.

### [#1196] Check logging level priorities
The levels for logging have been updated according to Log Levels in Swift. (https://www.swift.org/server/guides/libraries/log-levels.html).
There's one naming difference, instead of `notice` we use `event`. So the order is debug, info, event, warning, error.

### [#1111] Change how the sync progress is stored inside the SDK

`Initializer` has now a new parameter called `generalStorageURL`. This URL is the location of the directory
where the SDK can store any information it needs. A directory doesn't have to exist. But the SDK must
be able to write to this location after it creates this directory. It is suggested that this directory is
a subdirectory of the `Documents` directory. If this information is stored in `Documents` then the
system itself won't remove these data.

Synchronizer's prepare(...) public API changed: `viewingKeys:
[UnifiedFullViewingKey]` has been removed and `for walletMode: WalletInitMode`
added. `WalletInitMode` is an enum with 3 cases: .newWallet, .restoreWallet and
.existingWallet. Use `.newWallet` when preparing the SDKSynchronizer for a
brand new wallet that has been generated. Use `.restoreWallet` when wallet is
about to be restored from a seed and `.existingWallet` for all other scenarios.

## Removed

### [#1181] Correct computation of progress for Spend before Sync
`latestScannedHeight` and `latestScannedTime` have been removed from `SynchronizerState`. With multiple algorithms
of syncing the amount of data provided is reduced so it's consistent. Spend before Sync is done in non-linear order
so both Height and Time don't make sense anymore.

### [#1230] Remove linear sync from the SDK

- `latestScannedHeight` and `latestScannedTime` have been removed from the
  SynchronizerState.
- The concept of pending transaction has changed: `func allPendingTransactions()`
  is no longer available. Use `public func allTransactions()` instead.

## Fixed

- [#1037] Empty string memo throws `ZcashError.memoTextInputEndsWithNullBytes`
- [#1016] Rebuild download stream periodically while downloading
This fixes a memory consumption issue coming from GRPC-Swift.
- [#1019] Memo has trailing garbled text

### [#1111] Change how the sync progress is stored inside the SDK

`Initializer` has now a new parameter called `generalStorageURL`. This URL is the location of the directory
where the SDK can store any information it needs. A directory doesn't have to exist. But the SDK must
be able to write to this location after it creates this directory. It is suggested that this directory is
a subdirectory of the `Documents` directory. If this information is stored in `Documents` then the
system itself won't remove these data.

### [#1019] Memo has trailing garbled text

Changes the way unpadded bytes are turned into a UTF-8 Swift String
without using cString assuming APIs that would overflow memory and
add garbled trailing bytes.

- [#781] This fixes test `testMaxAmountMinusOneSend` by creating two separate tests:
  - testMaxAmountMinusOneSendFails
  - testMaxAmountSend

Also includes new functionality that tracks sent transactions so
that users can be notified specifically when they are mined and uses "idea B" of
issue #1033.

closes #1033
closes #781

### [#1001] Remove PendingDb in favor of `v_transactions` and `v_tx_output` Views

## Changed

- `WalletTransactionEncoder` now uses a `LightWalletService` to submit the
encoded transactions.

- Functions returning or receiving `ZcashTransaction.Sent` or `ZcashTransaction.Received` now
will be simplified by returning `ZcashTransaction.Overview` or be replaced by their Overview
counterparts

## Added

- `ZcashTransaction.Overview` can be checked for "pending-ness" by calling`.isPending(latestHeight:)` latest height must be provided so that minedHeight
  can be compared with the lastest and the `defaultStaleTolerance` constant.

- `TransactionRecipient` is now a public type.

- `ZcashTransaction.Output` can be queried to know the inner details of a
  `ZcashTransaction.Overview`. It will return an array with all the tracked
  outputs for that transaction so that they can be shown to users who request them

- `ZcashTransaction.Overview.State` is introduced to represent `confirmed`,
  `pending` or `expired` states. This State is relative to the current height
  of the chain that is passed to the function `getState(for currentHeight: BlockHeight)`.

State should be a transient value and it's not adviced to store it unless
transactions have stale values such as `confirmed` or `expired`.

### Synchronizer Changes

- `public func getTransactionOutputs(transaction) async -> [ZcashTransaction.Output]` is added to
get the outputs related to the given transaction. You can use this to know every detail of the
transaction Overview and show it in a more fine-grained UI.

- `TransactionRecipient` is returned on `getRecipients(for:)`.

## Renamed

- `AccountEntity` called `Account` is now `DbAccount`

## Removed

- `ZcashTransaction.Received` and `ZcashTransaction.Sent` are removed
  and replaced by `Overview` since the notion of Sent and received is
  not entirely applicable to Zcash transactions where value can be
  sent and received at the same time. Transactions with negative value
  will be considered as "sent" but that won't be enforced with a type
  anymore
- `cancelSpend()`: support for cancel spend was removed since its
  completion was not guaranteed
- `PendingTransactionEntity` and all of its related components.
  Pending items are still tracked and visualized by the existing APIs
  but they are retrieved from the `TransactionRepository` instead by
  returning `ZcashTransaction.Overview` instead.
- `pendingDbURL` is removed from every place it was required. Its
  deletion is responsibility of wallet developers.
- `ClearedTransactions` are now just `transactions`.`MigrationManager`
  is deleted. Now all migrations are in charge of the rust welding layer.
- `PendingTransactionDao.swift` is removed.
- `PendingTransactionRepository` protocol is removed.
- `TransactionManagerError`
- `PersistentTransactionManager`
- `OutboundTransactionManager` is deleted and replaced by `TransactionEncoder`
  which now incorporates `submit(encoded:)` functionality
- `DatabaseMigrationManager` is remove since it's no longer needed all Database
  migrations shall be hanlded by the rust layer.
- `ZcashSDK.defaultPendingDbName` along with any sibling members
- `TransactionRepository`
    - `findMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received)`
    - `findMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent)`

### [#1013] Enable more granular control over logging behavior

Now the SDK allows for more fine-tuning of its logging behavior. The `LoggingPolicy` enum
provides for three options: `.default(OSLogger.LogLevel)` wherein the SDK will use its own logger, with the option
to customize the log level by passing an `OSLogger.LogLevel` to the enum case.
`custom` allows one to pass a custom `Logger` implementation for completely customized logging.
Lastly, `noLogging` disables logging entirely.

To utilize this new configuration option, pass a `loggingPolicy` into the `Initializer`. If unspecified, the SDK
will utilize an internal `Logger` implementation with an `OSLogger.LogLevel` of `.debug`

### [#442] Implement parallel downloading and scanning

The SDK now parallelizes the download and scanning of blocks. If the network connection of the client device is fast enough then the scanning
process doesn't have to wait for blocks to be downloaded. This makes the whole sync process faster.

`Synchronizer.stop()` method is not async anymore.

### [#361] Redesign errors inside the SDK

Now the SDK uses only one error type - `ZcashError`. Each method that throws now throws only `ZcashError`.
Each publisher (or stream) that can emit error now emitts only `ZcashError`.

Each symbol in `ZcashError` enum represents one error. Each error is used only in one place
inside the SDK. Each error has assigned unique error code (`ZcashErrorCode`) which can be used in logs.

### [#969] Clear cache on error to avoid discontinuities when verifying
This change drops the file-system cache whenever an error occurs when storing blocks
so that there is not a discontinuity in the cached block range that could cause a
discontinuity error on libzcashlc when calling `scan_blocks`. This will have a setback of
at most 100 blocks that would have to be re-downloaded when resuming sync.

### [#959] and [#914] Value of outbound transactions does not match user intended tx input

This change switches to a new (future) version of the rust crates that will get
rid of the sent and received transactions Views in favor of a v_transaction
view that will do better accounting of outgoing and incoming funds.
Additionally it will support an outputs view for seeing the inner details of
transactions enabling the SDKs tell the users the precise movement of value
that a tx causes in its multiple possible ways according to the protocol.

the v_tx_outputs view is not yet implemented.

Sent and Received transaction sub-types are kept for compatibility purposes but
they are generated from Overviews instead of queried from a specific view.

In the transaction Overview the value represents the whole value transfer for
the transaction from the point of view of a given account including fees. This
means that the value for a single transaction Overview struct represents the
addition or subtraction of ZEC value to the account's balance.

Future updates will give clients the possibility to drill into the inner
workings of those value changes in a per-output basis for each transaction.

Also, the field pending_unmined field was added to v_transactions so that
wallets can query DataDb for pending but yet unmined txs

This will prepare the field for removing the notion of a "PendingDb" and its nuances.

### [#888] Updates to layer between Swift and Rust

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

`KeyDeriving` protocol is changed. And therefore `DerivationTool` is changed. `deriveUnifiedSpendingKey(seed:accountIndex:)` and
`deriveUnifiedFullViewingKey(from:)` methods are now async. `DerivationTool` offers alternatives for these methods. Alternatives are using either
closures or Combine.

### [#469] ZcashRustBackendWelding to Async

This is mostly internal change. But it also touches the public API.

These methods previously returned Optional and now those methods return non-optional value and those methods can an throw error:
- `getSaplingAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> SaplingAddress`
- `func getUnifiedAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> UnifiedAddress`
- `func getTransparentAddress(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> TransparentAddress`

These methods are now async:
- `func getShieldedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`
- `func getShieldedVerifiedBalance(accountIndex: Int) async throws -> Zatoshi`

`Initializer` no longer have methods to get balance. Use `SDKSynchronizer` (or it's alternative APIs) to get balance.

  Int64 value.

Initializer:
- `func getBalance(account index: Int = 0) -> Int64`
  use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an
  Int64 value.
- `func getVerifiedBalance(account index: Int = 0) -> Int64`
  use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an
  Int64 value.

ZcashSDK.NetworkConstants:
- `func defaultFee(for height: BlockHeight) -> Int64`
  use the API retuning Zatoshi instead. If needed `zatoshi.amount` would return an

ZcashRustBackendWelding:
- `func getReceivedMemoAsUTF8(dbData:idNote:networkType:) -> String?`
  Use `getReceivedMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead
- `func getSentMemoAsUTF8(dbData:idNote:networkType:) -> String?`
  Use `getSentMemo(dbData:idNote:networkType)` instead

## Changed

### [#209] Support Initializer Aliases

Added `ZcashSynchronizerAlias` enum which is used to identify an instance of the `SDKSynchronizer`. All the paths
to all resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are updated automatically inside the SDK according to the
alias. So it's safe to create multiple instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`. Each instance must have unique Alias. If
the `default` alias is used then the SDK works the same as before this change was introduced.

The SDK now also checks which aliases are used and it prevents situations when two instances of the `SDKSynchronizer`
has the same alias. Methods `prepare()` and `wipe()` do checks for used alias. And those methods fail
with `InitializerError.aliasAlreadyInUse` if the alias is already used.

If the alias check fails in the `prepare()` method then the status of the `SDKSynchronizer` isn't switched from `unprepared`.
These methods newly throw `SynchronizerError.notPrepared` error when the status is `unprepared`:
- `sendToAddress(spendingKey:zatoshi:toAddress:memo:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `shieldFundsspendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold:) async throws -> PendingTransactionEntity`
- `latestUTXOs(address:) async throws -> [UnspentTransactionOutputEntity]`
- `refreshUTXOs(address:from:) async throws -> RefreshedUTXOs`
- `rewind(policy:) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error>`

Provided file URLs to resources (databases, filesystem block storage...) are now parsed inside the SDK and updated
according to the alias. If some error during this happens then `SDKSynchronzer.prepare()` method throws
`InitializerError.cantUpdateURLWithAlias` error.

### [#831] Add support for alternative APIs

There are two new protocols (`ClosureSynchronizer` and `CombineSynchronizer`). And there are two new
objects which conform to respective protocols (`ClosureSDKSynchronizer` and `CombineSDKSynchronizer`). These
new objects offer alternative API for the `SDKSynchronizer`. Now the client app can choose which technology
it wants to use to communicate with Zcash SDK and it isn't forced to use async.

These methods in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `prepare(with:viewingKeys:walletBirthday:)`
- `start(retry:)`
- `stop()`
- `cancelSpend(transaction:)`
- All the variants of the `getMemos(for:)` method.
- All the variants fo the `getRecipients(for:)` method.
- `allConfirmedTransactions(from:limit:)`

These properties in the `SDKSynchronizer` are now async:
- `pendingTransactions`
- `clearedTransactions`
- `sentTransactions`
- `receivedTransactions`

Non async `SDKsynchronizer.latestHeight(result:)` were moved to `ClosureSDKSynchronizer`.

### [#724] Switch from event based notifications to state based notifications

The `SDKSynchronizer` no longer uses `NotificationCenter` to send notifications.
Notifications are replaced with `Combine` publishers. Check the migrating document and
documentation in the code to get more information.

### [#826] Change how the SDK is initialized

- `viewingKeys` and `walletBirthday` are removed from `Initializer` constuctor. These parameters moved to
  `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` function.
- Constructor of the `SDKSynchronizer` no longer throws exception.
- Any value emitted from `lastState` stream before `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` is called has `latestScannedHeight` set to 0.
- `Initializer.initialize` function isn't public anymore. To initialize SDK call `SDKSynchronizer.prepare` instead.

## Fixed

### [#821] `failedToWriteMetadata` at sync startup

No public API changes.

Adds `func shouldClearBlockCacheAndUpdateInternalState() -> BlockHeight?` to `SyncRanges`
so that the compact block processor can advert internal states that are not consistent and
recover from such state.

For concrete examples check out the tests in:
`Tests/NetworkTests/CompactBlockProcessorTests.swift`

## Deleted
Removed linter binary from repository

# 0.19.0-beta

### [#816] Improve how rewind call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.rewind(policy:)` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the rewind is done. For more details read the documentation for this method
in the code.

### [#801] Improve how wipe call can be used

`SDKSynchronizer.wipe()` function can be now called anytime. It returns `AnyPublisher` which
completes or fails when the wipe is done. For more details read the documentation for this method
in the code.

### [#793] Send synchronizerStopped notification only when sync process stops

`synchronizerStopped` notification is now sent after the sync process stops. It's
not sent right when `stop()` method is called.

### [#795] Include sapling-spend file into bundle for tests

This is only an internal change and doesn't change the behavior of the SDK. `Initializer`'s
constructor has a new parameter `saplingParamsSourceURL`. Use `SaplingParamsSourceURL.default`
value for this parameter.

### [#764] Refactor communication between components inside th SDK

This is mostly an internal change. A consequence of this change is that all the notifications
delivered via `NotificationCenter` with the prefix `blockProcessor` are now gone. If affected
notifications were used in your code use notifications with the prefix `synchronizer` now.
These notifications are defined in `SDKSynchronizer.swift`.

### [#759] Remove Jazz-generated HTML docs

We remove these documents since they are outdated and we rely on the docs in the code itself.

### [#726] Modularize GRPC layer

This is mostly internal change. `LightWalletService` is no longer public. If it
is used in your code replace it by using `SDKSynchronizer` API.

### [#770] Update GRPC swift library
This updates to GRPC-Swift 1.14.0.

## File system backed block cache

File system based block cache. Compact blocks will now be stored
on the file system. Caller must provide a `URL` pointing to the
filesystem root directory where the fsBlock cache is. this directory
is expected to contain a `/blocks` sub-directory with the blocks stored
in the convened filename format `{height}-{hash}-compactblock`. This directory
must be granted both read and write permissions.

the file system cache will have a "bookkeeping" database that the rust
welding layer will use to know the state of the cache and locate the
cached compact blocks. This directory can be deleted provided that the
Compactblock processor or Synchronizer are not running. Upon deletion
caller is responsible for initializing these objects for the cache to
be created.

Implementation notes: Users of the SDK will know the path they will
provide but must assume no behavior whatsoever or rely on the cached
information in any way, since it is an internal state of the SDK.
Maintainers might provide no support for problems related to speculative
use of the file system cache. If you consider your application needs any
other information than the one available through public APIs, please
file the corresponding feature request.

### Added

- `Synchronizer.shieldFunds(spendingKey:memo:shieldingThreshold)` shieldingThreshold
was added allowing wallets to manage their own shielding policies.

### Removed
- `InitializerError.cacheDbMigrationFailed`

### Deprecations
CacheDb references that were deprecated instead of **deleted** are pointing out
that they should be useful for you to migrate from using cacheDb.

- `ResourceProvider.cacheDbURL` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients
to move away from cacheDb.

- `NetworkConstants.defaultCacheDbName` deprecated but left for one release cycle for clients
to move away from cacheDb.

### [#767] implement getRecipients() for Synchronizer.

This implements `getRecipients()` function which retrieves the possible
recipients from a sent transaction. These can either be addresses or
internal accounts depending on the transaction being a shielding tx
or a regular outgoing transaction.

Other changes:

# 0.18.0-beta

## Farewell Cocoapods.
### [#612] Remove Support for Cocoapods (#706)

It wouldn't have been possible to release an SDK without you, pal.

We are moving away from Cocoapods since our main dependencies, SwiftGRPC
and SWIFT-NIO are. We don't have much of a choice.

We've been communicating this for a long time. Although, if you really need Cocoapods,
please let us know by opening an issue in our repo and we'll talk about it.

## Bugfixes

### [#645] Default rewind after ReOrg is 20 blocks when it should be 10
This fixes an issue where the default reorg was 20 blocks rewind instead of 10. The
reorg count was incremented before calling the rewind height computing function.

## Use Librustzcash database views to query and represent transactions

### [#556] Change data structures which represent transactions.

These data types are gone: `Transaction`, `TransactionEntity`, `ConfirmedTransaction`,
`ConfirmedTransactionEntity`. And these data types were added: `ZcashTransaction.Overview`,
`ZcashTransaction.Received`, `ZcashTransaction.Sent`.

New data structures are very similar to the old ones. Although there many breaking changes.
The APIs of the `SDKSynchronizer` remain unchanged in their behavior. They return different
data types. **When adopting this change, you should check which data types are used by methods
of the `SDKSynchronizer` in your code and change them accordingly.**

New transaction structures no longer have a `memo` property. This responds to the fact that
Zcash transactions can have either none or multiple memos. To get memos for the transaction
the `SDKSynchronizer` has now new methods to fetch those:
- `func getMemos(for transaction: ZcashTransaction.Overview) throws -> [Memo]`,
- `func getMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received) throws -> [Memo]`
- `func getMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent) throws -> [Memo]`

## CompactBlockProcessor is now internal
### [#671] Make CompactBlockProcessor Internal.


The CompactBlockProcessor is no longer a public class/API. Any direct access will
end up as a compiler error. Recommended way how to handle things is via `SDKSynchronizer`
from now on. The Demo app has been updated accordingly as well.

## We've changed how we download and scan blocks. Status reporting has changed.

### [#657] Change how blocks are downloaded and scanned.

In previous versions, the SDK first downloaded all the blocks and then it
scanned all the blocks. This approach requires a lot of disk space. The SDK now
behaves differently. It downloads a batch of blocks (100 by default), scans those, and
removes those blocks from the disk. And repeats this until all the blocks are processed.

`SyncStatus` was changed. `.downloading`, `.validating`, and `.scanning` symbols
were removed. And the `.scanning` symbol was added. The removed phases of the sync
process are now reported as one phase.

Notifications were also changed similarly. These notifications were
removed: `SDKSynchronizerDownloading`, `SDKSyncronizerValidating`, and `SDKSyncronizerScanning`.
And the `SDKSynchronizerSyncing` notification was added. The added notification replaces
the removed notifications.

## New Wipe Method to delete wallet information. Use with care.

### [#677] Add support for wallet wipe into SDK. Add new method `Synchronizer.wipe()`.

## Benchmarking APIs: A primer

### [#663] Foundations for the benchmarking/performance testing in the SDK.

This change presents 2 building blocks for the future automated tests, consisting
of a new SDKMetrics interface to control flow of the data in the SDK and
new performance (unit) test measuring synchronization of 100 mainnet blocks.

# 0.17.4-beta

### [#665] Fix testShieldFunds() `get_transparent_balance` error
updates `libzcashlc` to `0.1.1` to fix an error where getting a
transparent balance on an empty database would fail.

# 0.17.3-beta

### [#646] SDK sync process resumes to previously saved block height
This change adds an internal storage test on UserDefaults that tells the
SDK where sync was left off when cancelled whatever the reason for it
to restart on a later attempt. This fixes some issues around syncing
long block ranges in several attempts not enhancing the right transactions
because the enhancing phase would only consider the last range scanned.
This only fixes the situation where rewinding the SDK would cause the
whole database to be cleared instead and syncing to be restarted from
scratch (issue [#660]).

- commit `3b7202c` Fix `testShieldFunds()` dataset loading issue. (#659)

- [#532] [0.16.x-beta] Download does not stop correctly

  Issue Reported:

  When the synchronizer is stopped, the processor does not cancel
  the download correctly. Then when attempting to resume sync, the
  synchronizer is not on `.stopped` and can't be resumed

  this doesn't appear to happen in `master` branch that uses
  structured concurrency for operations.

  Fix:

  This commit makes sure that the download streamer checks cancelation
  before processing any block, or getting called back to report progress
