# Unreleased

- [#645] Default rewind after ReOrg is 20 blocks when it should be 10
    This fixes an issue where the default reorg was 20 blocks rewind instead of 10. The
reorg count was incremented before calling the rewind height computing function.
 
- [#556] Change data structures which represent transactions.

    These data types are gone: `Transaction`, `TransactionEntity`, `ConfirmedTransaction`, 
`ConfirmedTransactionEntity`. And these data types were added: `ZcashTransaction.Overview`, 
`ZcashTransaction.Received`, `ZcashTransaction.Sent`. 

    New data structures are very similar to the old ones. Although there many breaking changes.
The APIs of the `SDKSynchronizer` remain unchanged in their behavior. They return different 
data types. **When adopting this change, you should check which data types are used by methods 
of the `SDKSynchronizer` in your code and change them accordingly.**

    New transaction structures no longer have a `memo` property. This responds to the fact that 
Zcash transactions can have either none or multiple memos. To get memos for the transaction 
the `SDKSynchronizer` has now new methods to fetch those:
    - `func getMemos(for transaction: ZcashTransaction.Overview) throws -> [Memo]`, 
    - `func getMemos(for receivedTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Received) throws -> [Memo]`
    - `func getMemos(for sentTransaction: ZcashTransaction.Sent) throws -> [Memo]`
    
- [#671] Make CompactBlockProcessor Internal.

    The CompactBlockProcessor is no longer a public class/API. Any direct access will
end up as a compiler error. Recommended way how to handle things is via `SDKSynchronizer`
from now on. The Demo app has been updated accordingly as well.

- [#657] Change how blocks are downloaded and scanned. 

    In previous versions, the SDK first downloaded all the blocks and then it
scanned all the blocks. This approach requires a lot of disk space. The SDK now 
behaves differently. It downloads a batch of blocks (100 by default), scans those, and
removes those blocks from the disk. And repeats this until all the blocks are processed.

    `SyncStatus` was changed. `.downloading`, `.validating`, and `.scanning` symbols
were removed. And the `.scanning` symbol was added. The removed phases of the sync 
process are now reported as one phase. 

    Notifications were also changed similarly. These notifications were
removed: `SDKSynchronizerDownloading`, `SDKSyncronizerValidating`, and `SDKSyncronizerScanning`.
And the `SDKSynchronizerSyncing` notification was added. The added notification replaces
the removed notifications.
        
- [#677] Add support for wallet wipe into SDK. Add new method `Synchronizer.wipe()`. 

- [#663] Foundations for the benchmarking/performance testing in the SDK. 

    This change presents 2 building blocks for the future automated tests, consisting
of a new SDKMetrics interface to control flow of the data in the SDK and 
new performance (unit) test measuring synchronization of 100 mainnet blocks.

# 0.17.4-beta
- [#665] Fix testShieldFunds() `get_transparent_balance` error
updates `libzcashlc` to `0.1.1` to fix an error where getting a 
transparent balance on an empty database would fail.
# 0.17.3-beta
- [#646] SDK sync process resumes to previously saved block height
This change adds an internal storage test on UserDefaults that tells the 
SDK where sync was left off when cancelled whatever the reason for it
to restart on a later attempt. This fixes some issues around syncing
long block ranges in several attempts not enhancing the right transactions
because the enhancing phase would only consider the last range scanned.
This only fixes the situation where rewinding the SDK would cause the 
whole database to be cleared instead and syncing to be restarted from 
scratch (issue [#660]).

# 0.16.10-beta
- [#532] [0.16.x-beta] Download does not stop correctly

Issue Reported:

When the synchronizer is stopped, the processor does not cancel
the download correctly. Then when attempting to resume sync, the
synchronizer is not on `.stopped` and can't be resumed

this doesn't appear to happen in `master` branch that uses
structured concurrency for operations.

Fix:
This commit makes sure that the download streamer checks cancelation
before processing any block, or getting called back to report progress

`SynchronizerError` has a default `LocalizedError` compliance to

to get rid of cryptic errors that are being reported to maintainers and 
are subject to change in future versions.

# 0.15.0-beta
** IMPORTANT ** This version no longer supports iOS 12
We've made a decision to make iOS 13 the minimum deployment target
in order to adopt and support Structured Concurrency and other important features
of the Swift language like Combine. 

- [#363] bump iOS minimum deployment target to iOS 13.0 (#407)
- [#381] Move Zatoshi and Amount Types to the SDK (#396)
This deprecates many methods on `SDKSynchronizer` using Zatoshi for amounts
instead of `Int64`. This exposes number formatters that conveniently provide
decimal conversion from `Zatoshi` to "human-readable" ZEC decimal numbers.

- [#397] Checkpoint format that supports NU5 TreeStates (#399)
`WalletBirthday` now have both `saplingTree` and `orchardTree` values. The
latter being Optional for checkpoints prior to Orchard activation height.

- [#401] DecodingError when refreshing pending transactions (#402)
- [#394] Update swift-grpc to 1.8.0 (#395)

other changes: renamed changelog.md to CHANGELOG.md
# 0.14.0-beta
- [#388] Integrate libzcashlc 0.0.3 to support v5 transaction parsing on NU5 activation
# 0.13.1-beta
- [#326] Load Checkpoint files from bundle.
This is great news! now checkpoints are loaded from files on the bundle instead of
hardcoding them on source files. This will make updates easier, less error prone,
and mostly automatable.
