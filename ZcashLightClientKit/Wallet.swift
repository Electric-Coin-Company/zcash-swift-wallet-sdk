/**
 Represents the wallet's birthday which can be thought of as a checkpoint at the earliest moment in history where
 transactions related to this wallet could exist. Ideally, this would correspond to the latest block height at the
 time the wallet key was created. Worst case, the height of Sapling activation could be used (280000).
 
 Knowing a wallet's birthday can significantly reduce the amount of data that it needs to download because none of
 the data before that height needs to be scanned for transactions. However, we do need the Sapling tree data in
 order to construct valid transactions from that point forward. This birthday contains that tree data, allowing us
 to avoid downloading all the compact blocks required in order to generate it.
 
 New wallets can ignore any blocks created before their birthday.
 
 - Parameter height the height at the time the wallet was born
 - Parameter hash the block hash corresponding to the given height
 - Parameter time the time the wallet was born, in seconds
 - Parameter tree the sapling tree corresponding to the given height. This takes around 15 minutes of processing to
 generate from scratch because all blocks since activation need to be considered. So when it is calculated in
 advance it can save the user a lot of time.
