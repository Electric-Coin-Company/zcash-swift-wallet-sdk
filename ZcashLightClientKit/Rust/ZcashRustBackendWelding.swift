     This function is built on the core assumption that the information provided in the
     cache database is more likely to be accurate than the previously-scanned information.
     This follows from the design (and trust) assumption that the `lightwalletd` server
     provides accurate block information as of the time it was requested.
- Returns:
     * `-1` if the combined chain is valid.
     * `upper_bound` if the combined chain is invalid.
     * `upper_bound` is the height of the highest invalid block (on the assumption that the highest block in the cache database is correct).
     * `0` if there was an error during validation unrelated to chain validity.
     - Important: This function does not mutate either of the databases.

     against previously-scanned blocks. In particular, this function **assumes** that the
     caller is handling rollbacks.
     For brand-new light client databases, this function starts scanning from the Sapling
     activation height. This height can be fast-forwarded to a more recent block by calling
     [`zcashlc_init_blocks_table`] before this function.
     Scanned blocks are required to be height-sequential. If a block is missing from the
     cache, an error will be signalled.
