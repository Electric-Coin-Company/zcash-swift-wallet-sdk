    /**
    * Checks that the scanned blocks in the data database, when combined with the recent
    * `CompactBlock`s in the cache database, form a valid chain.
    * This function is built on the core assumption that the information provided in the
    * cache database is more likely to be accurate than the previously-scanned information.
    * This follows from the design (and trust) assumption that the `lightwalletd` server
    * provides accurate block information as of the time it was requested.
    * Returns:
    * - `-1` if the combined chain is valid.
    * - `upper_bound` if the combined chain is invalid.
    * `upper_bound` is the height of the highest invalid block (on the assumption that the
    * highest block in the cache database is correct).
    * - `0` if there was an error during validation unrelated to chain validity.
    * This function does not mutate either of the databases.

    * against previously-scanned blocks. In particular, this function **assumes** that the
    * caller is handling rollbacks.
    * For brand-new light client databases, this function starts scanning from the Sapling
    * activation height. This height can be fast-forwarded to a more recent block by calling
    * [`zcashlc_init_blocks_table`] before this function.
    * Scanned blocks are required to be height-sequential. If a block is missing from the
    * cache, an error will be signalled.
