    // `didUpdate` is closure that action use to tell CBP that some part of the work is done. For example if download action would like to
    // update progress on every block downloaded it can use this closure. Also if action doesn't need to update progress on partial work it doesn't
    // need to use this closure at all.

    // Each action updates context accordingly. It should at least set new state. Reason for this is that action can return different states for
    // different conditions. And action is the thing that knows these conditions.
