Serves as a source of compact blocks received from the light wallet server. Once started, it will use the given
lightwallet service to request all the appropriate blocks and compact block store to persist them. By delegating to
these dependencies, the downloader remains agnostic to the particular implementation of how to retrieve and store
data; although, by default the SDK uses gRPC and SQL.
- Property lightwalletService: the service used for requesting compact blocks
- Property storage: responsible for persisting the compact blocks that are received
